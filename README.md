# bikewise
The Cascade Bicycle Club and Phil Mitchell created bikewise.org as a place where cyclists could share road hazards and bicycle accident information, as well as bike thefts. In 2014 they transfered the project to BikeIndex.org. We're porting it to rails and integrating it with the Bike Index as an open source project.
